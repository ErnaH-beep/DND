Create a folder for example "SemProject"
Next open that folder in VS Code, then open the terminal and go to git
Set remote to be the repo and call it DND
Now, write "git pull DND main", and you should have the project

To run the project have two terminals open and from the SepProject folder write "cd Project" then "cd Backend" and the same for the front end "cd Project" then "cd Frontend"
Now to in the backend terminal write "dotnet run", and in the frontend terminal write "dotnet watch"

Thanks future me!
